# 1.2 - Are 2 strings permutations?

* _Javascript_ DOES have String methods for .split(''), .join(''), and an Array method for .sort()
* _Java_ uses .charAt(i) to reference values in an array; arrays can be indexed with characters as well as numbers; int[] creates an array of integers; Java has .length() for strings; incrementers ++ and decrementers --
* When you create an array in _Java_, does fixed-typing guarantee the usability of incrementers/decrementers?
